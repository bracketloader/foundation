Open Mainframe Project webinars are offered to the community to educate about open source on the Mainframe. Webinars are offered by members, Open Mainframe Project incubating, and graduated projects.
Please note: We are unable to share leads due to the Linux Foundation privacy policy.

We have outlined content guidelines and timelines. Webinars that do not meet the requirements will be canceled.

You must provide your webinar details no later than 4 weeks before the webinar date. At least 2 weeks prior to the webinar date you must provide your complete and final slides.

If the webinar is canceled due to not meeting these guidelines, the member will not be allowed to schedule a webinar in the subsequent webinar period. That is, Platinum members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming quarter and Silver members may not schedule a webinar in the upcoming 6 months.

## Types of Webinars

Open Mainframe Project hosts two different types of webinars as outlined below.

### Member webinars

Member webinars are those presented by an Open Mainframe Project member. The webinar must comply with the webinar guidelines. A member can present any open source project, including an Open Mainframe Project project. If an Open Mainframe Project member presents solely about an Open Mainframe Project project and on behalf of the project, it is classified as a Project webinar. If the webinar contains information about an Open Mainframe Project project and includes information on how to do something with that project, it is classified as a Member webinar.

Members can host webinars depending on thier membership level. 

* Platinum and End-User Members can host 1 webinar per quarter, based on availability.
* Silver members can host 1 webinar every 6 months, based on availability.
* Academic and Associate members can host a webinar based on availability.

Open Mainframe Project Member webinars will have a "Member Webinar" preceding their webinar title.

### Project webinars

Project webinars are those on an Open Mainframe Project hosted project or working group. These webinars are presented by or on behalf of the project. If presented by a member about a project, this webinar is classified as a Project webinar. An example is a Zowe webinar presented by the Broadcom team. The webinar is classified as a Project webinar.

Projects and working groups can host webinars depending upon thier lifecycle stage.

* Graduated projects can hold a webinar quarterly
* Incubating projects can hold a webinar once a year

These webinars can communicate release launch details or provide a project update. 

Open Mainframe Project project webinars will have a “Project Webinar" preceding their webinar title.

## Webinar process

### Content guidelines

* Webinar topics should be comparable to what would be accepted in an Open Mainframe Summit talk.
* Any platforms, tools, or technologies you are describing must be open source.
* Not allowed:
** Sales or marketing pitches
** Unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies
* Webinars should not be promotional.
* It is NOT okay to mislead or misrepresent features of Open Mainframe Project projects.

Members can add a slide at the end of their webinar on where to get more information. Examples:

* Share contact info of speaker - twitter, slack, email
* Links to company websites
* Links to projects websites or Github
* Can advertise if they are hiring and who to contact if interested

Note: This is not a link to an Open Mainframe Project website or form on the Open Mainframe Project website.

Open Mainframe Project will review the statement, as we do for the content for the webinar, to approve the content. If changes are needed, we will provide suggested changes.

### Proposing a Webinar

To propose go to the [Open Mainframe Project Service Desk](https://servicedesk.openmainframeproject.org) to submit your webinar proposal, which should include:

- Company or Project Name
- Webinar Title and Abstract
- Speaker(s) with thier title and bio

Open Mainframe Project staff will work with you to schedule the webinar date and time. Once that is confirmed...

- Speakers will receive an unique invite to the webinar to join as a presenter ( do not share this link with others )
- The webinar will be listed on the [Open Mainframe Project Events page](https://openmainframeproject.org/events) and announced though the blog and social channels of the Open Mainframe Project.
- You will recieve an registration link and social card to promote your session in your channels.

As it gets closer to the webinar date, an email is sent confirming the webinar date is still good for you and outlines the next steps.

### Preparing the presentation

2 weeks prior to your webinar, upload your final webinar presentation to [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdNNja8FJJw5ZpCF8MzB4IP8w6XmOpGGgCezlbFjdc1049fQ/viewform) . All presentations must be reviewed prior to the webinar. Presentations not received 2 weeks before the webinar date will result in the webinar being canceled.

#### Helpful Notes on Presentation Design

* Obsolete, low-res (i.e., pixelated), and malformatted logos are an epidemic among conference presentations. High-res logos of projects, products, and companies are available in the [Open Mainframe Project artwork repository](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork) or Open Mainframe Project Landscape.The logos are all the most current (or you can open a pull request if they’re not).
* Please see the [branding guidelines](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/branding-guidelines) which covers things like abbreviating Open Mainframe Project as Open Mainframe Project as well as the proper capitalization of projects like Zowe.

### Day-Of Logistics

* Webinar Prep: ½ hour before the webinar starts. Soundcheck, webinar slides, moderation of the Q&A.
* Live Webinar: Starts at the top of the hour
* Typical timing of the webinar - approximately 5-minute introduction, 45-minute presentation, 10 minutes of Q&A
* Open Mainframe Project staff will help moderate (introduction, feeding questions to the presenter)
* Webinar Platform: Zoom

After the webinar, registration numbers, and a link to the webinar on YouTube will be shared with the company hosting the webinar. Open Mainframe Project does not provide a copy of the webinar recording for individual company use. Please note: We are unable to share the list of leads or include any promotions with the intention of driving leads.
